We are going to create a detailed module description for the Trust-Aware Vertical Federated Learning Framework. Since the user does not want code, we will focus on the architectural and functional description of each module.

We have 7 main modules:

Client Management Module

Federated Learning Server Module

Trust Evaluation Engine Module

Secure Aggregation Module

Blockchain Audit Module

Security & Honeypot Module

Admin Dashboard & Monitoring Module

We will describe each module in detail, including its purpose, components, and key functionalities.
